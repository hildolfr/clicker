# Clicker v2.1.1 Release Notes

**Release Date**: May 23, 2025  
**Version**: 2.1.1  
**Type**: Bugfix Release

Version 2.1.1 is a critical bugfix release that resolves autoupdate issues affecting users on systems without Python installed. This release ensures reliable application updates and improved user experience.

## üêõ Critical Bugfixes

### Autoupdate System Overhaul
**Issue**: Users were experiencing "Python missing" errors after autoupdates completed, preventing the application from restarting properly.

**Root Cause**: The autoupdate system was using flawed executable path detection logic that could result in restart commands pointing to Python scripts instead of the actual executable file.

**Resolution**: Complete overhaul of the autoupdate system with:
- **Enhanced Executable Path Detection**: Smart detection algorithm that searches for actual `.exe` files in common locations
- **Multi-layer Validation**: Multiple validation checks to ensure restart commands target executable files
- **Improved Batch Scripts**: Enhanced update scripts with built-in validation and error handling
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Better error messages and fallback mechanisms
- **Detailed Logging**: Enhanced logging for troubleshooting update issues

### Technical Details

#### Enhanced Path Detection Algorithm
```python
# NEW: Intelligent executable detection
possible_exe_paths = [
    script_dir / "Clicker.exe",  # Same directory as script
    script_dir / "dist" / "Clicker.exe",  # In dist subdirectory
    script_dir.parent / "Clicker.exe",  # Parent directory
    script_dir.parent / "dist" / "Clicker.exe",  # Parent/dist
]
```

#### Improved Update Script Validation
- Validates target paths are actual executable files
- Checks file existence before attempting restart
- Provides clear error messages when issues occur
- Includes fallback mechanisms for recovery

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- File size validation for download integrity
- Process validation for script execution
- Comprehensive logging throughout update process
- User-friendly error messages with recovery instructions

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Improvements

### Update Process Validation
- **Download Integrity**: Validates downloaded file size and accessibility
- **Script Validation**: Ensures update scripts are created successfully
- **Path Validation**: Confirms executable paths before restart attempts
- **Process Monitoring**: Tracks update script execution with proper error handling

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Clear Error Messages**: Improved error reporting with actionable instructions
- **Better Logging**: Enhanced logging for support and troubleshooting
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Better handling when automatic restart fails
- **Manual Recovery**: Clear instructions for manual update completion
