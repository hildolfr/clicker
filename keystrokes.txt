# Clicker Keystrokes Configuration
# 
# Format: [KEY] [DELAY]
#   - KEY: The key to press (can include modifiers)
#     * Use S- for Shift (e.g., S-a for Shift+A)
#     * Use C- for Control (e.g., C-v for Ctrl+V)
#     * Use A- for Alt (e.g., A-f4 for Alt+F4)

# Note: The order of keys in this file matters if "order_obeyed" is set to true
# in settings.json. When order_obeyed is false, keys will be sorted by delay.
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.
