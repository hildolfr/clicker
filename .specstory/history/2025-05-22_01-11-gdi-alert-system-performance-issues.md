# GDI Alert System Performance Issues (2025-05-21 18:11:04)

_**User**_

the last work we did was to implement a gdi alert system. not only does it work poorly -- it doesn't change on toggle state -- it also seems to be making the script perform poorly. please think it all over carefully.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll investigate the GDI indicator implementation and performance issues. Let me check the relevant code first.

Let's examine how the GDI indicator is initialized and how the toggle state is handled. Let me also look at the rest of the related code in main.py.

I need to look at how the GDI indicator is used in the actual automation toggle function, and also at the rest of the GDI indicator implementation:

---

Read file: main.py

Let me check the toggle and automation control functions to see how the GDI indicator's state is managed:

Let me also check how the automation worker is implemented since that might be causing performance issues:

---

Read file: main.py

---

Let me check how settings are loaded regarding the indicators:

Let me see the DEFAULT_SETTINGS definition:

Based on my analysis of the code, I've identified several issues with the GDI indicator implementation that could be causing the problems you're experiencing:

1. The indicator doesn't properly change on toggle state - this appears to be due to issues in the GDI drawing and message handling
2. Performance issues - the continuous redrawing in the render loop is likely causing overhead

Let's implement a more efficient indicator using DirectX/Win32 APIs. Here's my fix:

I've made several important improvements to the GDI indicator:

1. **Fixed the toggle state issue**:
   - Now the indicator state always changes when set_state is called (removed the conditional)
   - Improved drawing code with proper GDI object selection and cleanup
   - Fixed flickering by using matched pen/brush colors (eliminated black outlines)

2. **Improved performance**:
   - Reduced frame rate from 30 FPS to ~16 FPS (60ms sleep), which is plenty for a status indicator
   - Decreased CPU usage by reducing unnecessary operations in the render loop
   - Eliminated unnecessary state changes and window redraws
   - Increased the alpha change threshold to avoid frequent transparency updates

3. **Fixed time handling**: 
   - Switched from milliseconds to seconds for consistency
   - Simplified the time tracking logic

4. **Added proper GDI object management**:
   - Properly selecting and restoring GDI objects
   - Ensuring all objects are deleted after use
   - Added proper object management to prevent resource leaks

Try running the application now. The GDI indicator should:
1. Properly reflect the toggle state
2. Use less CPU resources
3. Have smoother animations
4. Appear correctly with the proper colors and shape

Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

this looks good -- question, please describe how this alert looks. dont change anything

---

_**Assistant**_



---

The GDI alert appears as a small semi-transparent overlay positioned in the middle-right of your screen. It has the following characteristics:

- Size: 150×50 pixels
- Background: Dark gray rectangular panel
- Position: Middle-right edge of the screen
- Transparency: 80% opacity that fades to 20% when inactive after 3 seconds

When automation is OFF:
- A static gray circle appears on the left side
- "AUTOMATION OFF" text in light gray appears to the right of the circle

When automation is ON:
- A green circle appears on the left side that alternates between bright green and darker green (flashing)
- "AUTOMATION ON" text in white appears to the right of the circle
- The indicator maintains full opacity while active

The alert remains visible even in fullscreen applications and allows mouse clicks to pass through it. It's designed to be noticeable but not intrusive.

_**User**_

the box and color are visible, the text is not. can you please consider why that might be? 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

The text is not showing because of an issue with the text drawing rectangle parameters. In the GDI indicator's `_draw` method, there's a problem with how we're defining the text's position and boundaries.

Looking at your current code, the text drawing uses:

```python
win32gui.DrawText(hdc, "AUTOMATION ON", -1, (55, self.height//2-10, self.width, self.height), 
                  win32con.DT_SINGLELINE | win32con.DT_LEFT)
```

The issue is in the rectangle parameter: `(55, self.height//2-10, self.width, self.height)`

This parameter should be a rectangle defined as (left, top, right, bottom), but we're passing (left, top, width, height). The Windows API expects the absolute coordinates of the rectangle boundaries, not width and height values.

To fix this, we need to calculate the correct right and bottom coordinates:

```python
win32gui.DrawText(hdc, "AUTOMATION ON", -1, (55, self.height//2-10, 55 + self.width, self.height//2+10), 
                  win32con.DT_SINGLELINE | win32con.DT_LEFT)
```

Additionally, we're not setting any font in the drawing code, so it's using the default system font which might not be optimal for this purpose.

ok, let's forego drawing text at all. let's just make the entire alert a small red rectangle that appears on the side of the screen and fades away entirely when off.

I'll implement a simplified alert that's just a small red rectangle when active and fades away entirely when inactive.

I've replaced the complex indicator with a much simpler one:

1. Now it's a small 30x30 square (instead of 150x50 rectangle)
2. When active, it shows as a bright red square that flashes between bright red and a darker red
3. When inactive, it completely fades away rather than staying partially visible
4. The fading behavior is quicker - it starts fading after 1 second (instead of 3) and fades completely in 1.5 seconds

The indicator remains in the same position at the middle-right edge of the screen and will still be visible in fullscreen applications. Since there's no text anymore, there's no need to worry about text rendering issues.

This should provide a clean, simple visual alert that's easy to see when active and completely out of the way when inactive.

this works. move the square to the bottom right of the screen.

          # Create an overlay window

I've moved the indicator to the bottom-right corner of the screen. The red square will now appear 20 pixels from both the right and bottom edges of your screen, providing a less intrusive but still visible indication of when automation is active.

we're running into some performance issues and hanging on exit since the gdi implementation. can you please look it over  thoroughly and think it through? I imagine there is a mishandled thread somewhere.

Looking at the GDI indicator implementation, I've found several potential issues that could cause performance problems and hanging on exit. Let me fix these issues:

I've made several significant improvements to fix the performance issues and hanging on exit:

1. **Better Thread Management**:
   - Added a dedicated exit event for signaling thread termination
   - Improved thread cleanup with better timeout handling
   - Added proper thread name for easier debugging
   - Added a safety check to prevent multiple threads starting

2. **Window and Resource Management**:
   - Added checks for window validity before every operation
   - Properly clean up DC (device context) resources
   - Removed the unnecessary SetWindowLong call that wasn't being used
   - Made sure all GDI objects are properly destroyed

3. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Limited rendering to 16 frames per second instead of constant updates
   - Added frame timing to prevent excessive CPU usage
   - Used event-based waiting instead of fixed sleep times
   - Added error handling around message pump calls

4. **Cleaner Exit Process**:
   - Added proper thread exit signaling
   - Increased thread join timeout to ensure complete shutdown
   - Added more detailed error logging during cleanup
   - Ensured resources are properly released during shutdown

These changes should solve the performance issues and hanging on exit. The indicator will now:
- Use significantly less CPU
- Respond better to application shutdown
- Clean up resources properly
- Avoid hanging when the application is closed

The visual behavior is the same: a small red square in the bottom-right corner that flashes when active and fades away when inactive.

something happening that prevents mouse movements on the dialog menu when the task tray icon is clicked; happened after gdi implementation. thoughts?

The issue is likely that the GDI window is intercepting mouse events despite the WS_EX_TRANSPARENT flag. This can happen when the window is set as TOPMOST and there are some specific interactions with the Windows message system.

Let's fix this by modifying the GDI indicator to properly handle input transparency:

---

I've identified and fixed the issue with the task tray menu. The GDI indicator was interfering with mouse events despite having the WS_EX_TRANSPARENT flag. Here's what I changed:

1. **Improved Window Creation**:
   - Added the WS_EX_NOACTIVATE flag to prevent the window from stealing focus
   - Used SW_SHOWNA (show without activating) when displaying the window
   - Reinforced the transparency settings after window creation

2. **Mouse Event Handling**:
   - Added explicit handling to ignore all mouse messages in the window procedure
   - This ensures mouse events pass through to windows beneath

3. **Selective Message Pump**:
   - Replaced the generic PumpWaitingMessages() with a more selective approach
   - Now explicitly filters out mouse and keyboard messages
   - Only processes paint and system messages to avoid interfering with Qt's event handling

These changes should fix the issue with the task tray menu, allowing you to interact with it normally while still showing the indicator. The GDI overlay will now be completely "transparent" to mouse events, even when it's visible on screen.

The visual behavior remains the same - a red square in the bottom-right that flashes when active and fades away when inactive, but now it won't interfere with any mouse interactions.

same bug, the mouse cannot select anything in the context menu even if the icon is right clicked; the context menu appears but the cursor cannot select or click anything

_**Assistant**_

Let's try a more drastic approach since the window is still interfering with mouse interaction. The most reliable solution is to temporarily hide the indicator window completely when the user is interacting with the system tray:

---

```diff
          self.hwnd = None
          self.hdc = None
+         self.hidden_for_menu = False  # Track if we've hidden the window for menu interaction
          
          # Position in bottom-right of primary screen
```

```diff
              raise
      
+     def hide_window(self):
+         """Hide the indicator window."""
+         if self.hwnd and win32gui.IsWindow(self.hwnd):
+             win32gui.ShowWindow(self.hwnd, win32con.SW_HIDE)
+             self.hidden_for_menu = True
+             logging.debug("GDI indicator hidden for menu interaction")
+     
+     def show_window(self):
+         """Show the indicator window if it was hidden."""
+         if self.hwnd and win32gui.IsWindow(self.hwnd) and self.hidden_for_menu:
+             win32gui.ShowWindow(self.hwnd, win32con.SW_SHOWNA)
+             self.hidden_for_menu = False
+             logging.debug("GDI indicator shown after menu interaction")
+     
      def _wnd_proc(self, hwnd, msg, wparam, lparam):
          """Window procedure for the overlay window."""
```

---

Now I need to modify the main function to connect these methods to the tray menu events:

---

```diff
          reload_action.triggered.connect(reload_all)
          quit_action.triggered.connect(cleanup_and_quit)
+         
+         # Hide GDI indicator when context menu is about to be shown
+         menu.aboutToShow.connect(lambda: gdi_indicator.hide_window() if gdi_indicator else None)
+         
+         # Show GDI indicator when context menu is closed
+         menu.aboutToHide.connect(lambda: gdi_indicator.show_window() if gdi_indicator else None)
          
          # Add double-click handler to toggle automation
```

---

I've taken a more direct approach to solve the issue. Instead of trying to make the GDI window click-through (which wasn't working properly), I've implemented a solution that:

1. **Completely hides the GDI indicator** when the context menu is about to show
2. **Restores the indicator** after the menu is closed

This is accomplished by:

1. Adding new `hide_window()` and `show_window()` methods to the GDI indicator class
2. Connecting these methods to the `aboutToShow` and `aboutToHide` signals of the tray menu
3. Tracking the hidden state to ensure proper restoration

Now when you right-click the tray icon:
1. The GDI indicator will temporarily hide itself completely
2. The context menu will appear and you'll be able to interact with it normally
3. After you select a menu item or close the menu, the indicator will reappear if it was visible before

This approach bypasses all the issues with transparency and mouse event handling by simply removing the interfering window during menu interaction. It's a more reliable solution that should completely fix the menu interaction problem.

this worked great.

Perfect! Glad the solution worked. The approach of temporarily hiding the indicator during menu interaction was more reliable than trying to make it truly click-through.
