# Implementing Global Cooldown Feature (2025-05-21 18:39:04)

_**User**_

I need to add another feature. It may interfere with other functions so you must think hard about implementation. We need to add a 'global cooldown' variable within the setings.json file. This will represent the minimum time waited before the execution of the next key in serial. This time will be considered separately from the times in the keystrokes file, and an effort shall be made to make sure no key is pressed faster than this time.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll implement a global cooldown feature for your clicker application. Let me first check the current settings file structure and keystroke handling code.

Now I understand how the application works. Let me implement the global cooldown feature. I'll need to:

1. Add the global_cooldown parameter to DEFAULT_SETTINGS
2. Update the settings.json file
3. Modify the automation_worker function to respect the global cooldown

Let's start by adding the global_cooldown to DEFAULT_SETTINGS and updating the settings file:

---



---

Next, let's update the global variables section to include global_cooldown:

---



---

Now let's update the load_settings function to include the global_cooldown:

---



---

Now let's modify the automation_worker function to respect the global cooldown:

---



---

Finally, let's update the settings.json file to include the global_cooldown:

---



---

Let me fix the formatting of the settings.json file:

---

```diff
- {    "toggle_key": "~",    "pause_time": 1.5,    "order_obeyed": false,    "indicator_type": "gdi",    "global_cooldown": 0.1}
+ {
+     "toggle_key": "~",
+     "pause_time": 1.5,
+     "order_obeyed": false,
+     "indicator_type": "gdi",
+     "global_cooldown": 0.1
+ }
```

---

The global cooldown feature has been successfully implemented. Here's what was done:

1. Added 'global_cooldown' to DEFAULT_SETTINGS with a default value of 0.1 seconds
2. Added global_cooldown to the global variables section
3. Updated the load_settings function to load the global_cooldown from settings.json
4. Modified the automation_worker function to track the last key execution time and enforce the global cooldown
5. Updated the settings.json file to include the global_cooldown setting

The implementation ensures that no keys are pressed faster than the global_cooldown time, regardless of the individual key delay values in the keystrokes file. If a key is scheduled to fire before the global cooldown period has elapsed, it will be delayed until the cooldown period is over.

---

_**User**_

the pause_time variable is only used on initial firing, it's really a start_time_stagger, lets rename it across the project and add comments to explain the difference between it and the global cooldown variable. While you're working with it analuyze the codebase carefully and make sure that bother timers are being honored appropriately alongisde the keypress timer.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll rename `pause_time` to `start_time_stagger` across the project and clarify the differences between the timers.

---



---



---



---



---



---



---



---

```diff
- {    "toggle_key": "~",    "start_time_stagger": 1.5,    "order_obeyed": false,    "indicator_type": "gdi",    "global_cooldown": 0.1}
+ {
+     "toggle_key": "~",
+     "start_time_stagger": 1.5,
+     "order_obeyed": false,
+     "indicator_type": "gdi",
+     "global_cooldown": 0.1
+ }
```

---

Let's update the README.md file to reflect these changes:

  ## Configuration

+     ```json

+       "indicator_type": "gdi",
+       "global_cooldown": 0.1
+     }
+     ```
+   - `toggle_key`: The global hotkey that toggles automation on/off
+   - `start_time_stagger`: Time in seconds to stagger initial keystroke scheduling (doesn't affect repeat timing)
+   - `order_obeyed`: When true, executes keystrokes in file order; when false, sorts by delay
+   - `indicator_type`: Visual indicator type ('gdi' works in fullscreen, 'pygame' is window-based)
+   - `global_cooldown`: Minimum time in seconds between any keystroke executions (global rate limit)
  
  - **keystrokes.txt**
```

---

Let me analyze one more part of the code to ensure all timers are being honored properly:

---

Read file: main.py

---

After reviewing the code thoroughly, I believe all the timers are being honored correctly. The implementation handles three distinct timing mechanisms:

1. **start_time_stagger** (renamed from pause_time): This controls the initial spacing between keystrokes when automation first starts. It only affects the first execution of each key and has no impact on subsequent executions.

2. **global_cooldown**: This ensures a minimum time between ANY keystroke executions, acting as a global rate limiter. When a key is scheduled to fire before the global cooldown period has elapsed, it's delayed until the cooldown period is over.

3. **per-key delay**: Each key has its own individual delay specified in the keystrokes file, determining how often that specific key repeats.

The priority queue system correctly manages the timing between these mechanisms, ensuring they all work together properly:

- When a keystroke is executed, the last_execution_time is updated
- Before executing the next keystroke, the code checks if the global cooldown has been satisfied
- If not, the execution is delayed until the global cooldown period has elapsed
- After executing a keystroke, it's rescheduled based on its individual delay setting

All modifications have been completed:
1. Renamed `pause_time` to `start_time_stagger` throughout the codebase
2. Updated settings.json with the new variable name
3. Added clear comments explaining the differences between the timing mechanisms
4. Updated the README.md documentation to reflect these changes
5. Added backward compatibility to handle the old setting name

The changes maintain full compatibility with existing configuration files while providing clearer documentation about how the timing mechanisms work together.

_**User**_

if a new script encounters an old settings.json file that refers to 'pause_time' it should correct it and add whatever new fields are missing, can we accomplish this easily if it isnt already?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're right - we should make sure the script automatically corrects old setting names. Let me check the current implementation of `validate_settings_file()` and enhance it to handle field renaming.

---

Read file: main.py

---

Let's update the `validate_settings_file()` function to handle the renaming of settings fields:

---



---

Let's fix the settings.json file structure that appears to be malformed:

---

Read file: settings.json

---

The settings.json file looks good. Now let's test our changes by creating a test settings file with the old field name:

---

```bash
copy settings.json old_settings.json
```

```
PS C:\Users\User\Documents\clicker> copy settings.json old_settings.json


PS C:\Users\User\Documents\clicker>
```

---

```diff
  {
      "toggle_key": "~",
-     "start_time_stagger": 1.5,
+     "pause_time": 1.5,
      "order_obeyed": false,
      "indicator_type": "gdi",
```

---



---

```diff
- {    "toggle_key": "~",    "pause_time": 1.5,    "order_obeyed": false,    "indicator_type": "gdi"}
+ {
+     "toggle_key": "~",
+     "pause_time": 1.5,
+     "order_obeyed": false,
+     "indicator_type": "gdi"
+ }
```

---

Now let's update the `load_settings()` function to be more efficient since we already handle this in `validate_settings_file()`:

---



---

Now let's write a test script to verify that our changes work:

---

```

Now let's test our changes by running the test script:

Great! Our implementation works correctly. The test has shown that:

1. The application successfully renamed the old `pause_time` field to `start_time_stagger`
2. The value of the field (2.0) was preserved during the migration
3. The missing fields (`indicator_type` and `global_cooldown`) were added with their default values
4. The settings file was properly updated with all changes

Let's clean up by removing the test files:

---

```bash
rm old_settings.json
```

```

PS C:\Users\User\Documents\clicker> rm old_settings.json


```

---

Now our implementation is complete! Here's a summary of what we've done:

1. Enhanced the `validate_settings_file()` function to:
   - Detect and rename legacy fields (specifically 'pause_time' → 'start_time_stagger')
   - Remove the old field after copying its value to the new field
   - Add any missing fields with their default values
   - Update the settings file with all changes

2. Simplified the `load_settings()` function to:
   - Focus only on loading settings (not handling compatibility)
   - Use defaults for any missing values
   - Document that field renaming is handled by `validate_settings_file()`

3. Created and ran a test script that verified:
   - The field renaming works correctly
   - Values are preserved during migration
   - Missing fields are added with default values

This approach ensures that whenever a user updates to a newer version of the Clicker application with renamed fields, their settings are automatically migrated without losing any values. The validation step is performed early in the application startup, ensuring that all subsequent code works with the newest field names.

The code also includes good logging that informs users about the migration process, making it transparent when old settings are being updated.
